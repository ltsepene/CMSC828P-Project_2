# CMSC828P-Project_2

## Plan of investigation

For this project, I would like to investigate further the results of the Liu et al. paper. Namely, I’d like to explore interesting correlations between mutational signature profiles, demographic features and the time duration from Cystectomy to Recurrence (PFS). Here is a list of intriguing possible experiments:
1.	Analyze the pre-treatment signature profiles of patients and try to discover any relation between that and their post-treatment signature profile. For example, does there exists a pre-treatment profile that strongly correlates with increased activity of the newly discovered cisplatin signature?
2.	Investigate possible correlations between post-treatment signature profiles (or even pre-treatment) with PFS. It would be interesting to find a strong correlation between increased activity of the cisplatin signature with PFS. If such correlation doesn’t exist, that would be a strong argument in favor of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, since in some sense that would indicate that reoccurrence of the disease is independent of the therapy, and the therapy itself doesn’t aggravate things. Also, independent of studying the effects of the new signature, seeing what signature profiles are more likely to cause early reoccurrence seems to be a meaningful question.
3.	I can also investigate correlations between pre/post-treatment mutational burden and PFS. I am also thinking of doing that using age instead of mutational burden.
